## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
Central Park is a famous public park in New York and there live a considerable amount of squirrels. However, the park is huge, so it may take some time to actually find or meet a squirrel. For those tourists, animal lovers, photographers or scientists who want to better observe squirrels, our app will make it easier to find more squirrels by showing squirrel population in different area in the park on a map and also allow users to see change of location of squirrels from morning to afternoon.

## Section 2: Description of the data



## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios
### -Research questions(draft)
1. How are the squirrels population distributed in Central Park. (Original one: In what part of Central Park are most squirrels found)
2. When(morning or afternoon) will be the better time to observe a squirrel’s specific behaviour?  (Original one: Is there a relationship between time of day (AM vs. PM) and squirrel behaviour? )

### -Usage scenario with tasks (tasks are indicated in brackets, i.e. [task])
John Doe works as a travelling photographer for a scientist magazine He is interested in taking pictures of animals and their behaviour. When he travels to New York, he plans to spend half a day in the Central Park and takes some photos of the squirrels. He hasn’t decided which part of the park he will be visit but he wants to [find] the nearest area when he arrived that has more squirrels for him to observe and take pictures of. He also wants to [identify] a time either in the morning or afternoon that he will have a higher change to see squirrels eating. When John open the “ See Squirrels in Central Park, NYC app”, he will firstly see a map of the Central Park. Then he can click on any area on the map to see the population of squirrels in that area or click multiple area to compare the numbers of squirrels in those area. By using this function, he can easily decided an area that has more squirrels based on where he is. For example, he is in Northwest corner right now, it is unnecessary for him to go all the way south to The Ramble to see more squirrels, instead, he can just go to Central Park West zone 1. Regarding what time John can have higher chance to see squirrels eating, he can just filter the behaviour to eating and it will show that there are more squirrels eating in afternoon. Based on these information, John will have a clear plan where and when he could better observe the squirrels and take better pictures efficiently within limited time frame.
