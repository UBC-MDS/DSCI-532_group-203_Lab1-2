## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose
Central Park is a famous public park in New York and there live a considerable amount of squirrels. However, the park is huge, so it may take some time to actually find or meet a squirrel. For those tourists, animal lovers, photographers or scientists who want to better observe squirrels, our app will make it easier to find more squirrels by showing squirrel population in different area in the park on a map and also allow users to see change of location of squirrels from morning to afternoon.
